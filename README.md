# Mailing for la-vie-scolaire

This is an application sending an email with the id and password to each user of la-vie-scolaire, 
only if this user didn't changed his password yet.

## Getting Started

Export la-vie-scolaire users in an xml file, and convert this xml file into an csv one.
Rename this csv file in `users.csv` and put it into the folder `root/resources/`.

Change your email and password in the `conf.txt` file.
Change the server if your email is not a Google one.

Then launch the app.
